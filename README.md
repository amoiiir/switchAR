## Abstract
SwitchAR is a mobile app that combines augmented reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to make controlling smart home devices easy and fun. This app is specially designed for homeowners, including elderly and disabled individuals who might find it hard to move around or use regular switches. With SwitchAR, they can control lights, temperature, and other home appliances directly from their smartphones, making daily tasks simpler and more accessible.

The project aims to address the challenges faced by many in using current smart home systems, which can be complex and difficult to manage. SwitchAR simplifies this by offering a single, easy-to-use platform that brings together all home devices. It's particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues, providing a way to control their home environment easily and independently, enhancing their quality of life.
