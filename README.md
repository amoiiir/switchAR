## Abstract
SwitchAR is a mobile app that combines augmented reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to make controlling smart home devices easy and fun. This app is specially designed for homeowners, including elderly and disabled individuals who might find it hard to move around or use regular switches. With SwitchAR, they can control lights, temperature, and other home appliances directly from their smartphones, making daily tasks simpler and more accessible.

The project aims to address the challenges faced by many in using current smart home systems, which can be complex and difficult to manage. SwitchAR simplifies this by offering a single, easy-to-use platform that brings together all home devices. It's particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues, providing a way to control their home environment easily and independently, enhancing their quality of life.

## Problem Statement
Right now, there are not many AR-integrated IoT mobile applications available in the market. Despite the fact that smart home automation has had a significant impact, there is still a market demand for a unified solution that is user-friendly and can meet the specific needs of homeowners, especially the elderly and disabled. For example, an elderly person who has difficulty moving around may find it difficult to reach and use traditional light switches. Furthermore, smart home devices lack customization and control options, making it difficult for users to fully utilize and control their devices. By using SwitchAR, they can easily control these devices with their smartphone while also increasing interactivity with smart home devices via augmented reality.

## Project Objectives
To develop an AR-integrated IoT mobile application (SwitchAR) that can allow users to easily control switches in their home environment.
Implement an automation feature where users can set conditions to automatically control devices.
Simplify setup and customization for users by automatically adding and configuring switches in SwitchAR, ensuring a hassle-free experience.
Integrate SwitchAR with Google Home Assistant for voice command capabilities, allowing users to control their smart home devices through spoken instructions.
